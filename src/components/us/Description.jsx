            <h2>VERDIN NEW YORK</h2>
            <p>
            is an eveningwear brand with an emphasis on beautiful silhouettes, dimensional textures and sophisticated nostalgia. The collection
            cultivates a look of elegant fragility with a sophisticated edge at a more reasonable price than other high-end brands.
            <br/><br/>
            In 2017, fashion industry veteran Gustavo Nunez launched VERDIN NEW YORK. Drawing from his 25 years of experience in both
            pattern making and production from such iconic brands as Marchesa and Rebecca Taylor, Gustavo saw an opportunity to create high
            quality collections that are accessible to both the affluent and ?? markets. His hands-on approach and exceptional experience
            enable him to deliver stunning ranges of colorful silhouettes with impeccable fits and constructions.
            <br/><br/>
            VERDIN is named for Gustavoâ€™s mother Maria who encouraged him to follow his creative passions as a child. He continues to find his
            inspiration from his vibrant Mexican culture in his choice of fabrics and embroideries.
            <br/><br/>
            Every VERDIN NEW YORK piece offers a carefully crafted silhouette that feels essential, set apart by distinctive details that capture
            the imagination and elevate the art of dressing up for a special occasion.
            <br/><br/>
            The VERDIN NEW YORK collection is available at NORDSTROMS in the USA, at Hugo Nicholson in Toronto, Black Boushiya in Dubai
            and selected boutiques in the USA.
